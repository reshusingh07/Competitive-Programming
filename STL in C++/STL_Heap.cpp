// In C++, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. A heap is commonly implemented as a binary heap, which is a complete binary tree where each node satisfies the heap property. The heap property can be either the "min-heap" property or the "max-heap" property:

// Min-Heap Property: In a min-heap, for every node i other than the root, the value of A[parent(i)] (the parent node) is less than or equal to the value of A[i] (the current node).
// Max-Heap Property: In a max-heap, for every node i other than the root, the value of A[parent(i)] is greater than or equal to the value of A[i].
// In C++, heaps are commonly implemented using the std::priority_queue class provided by the Standard Template Library (STL). Here's how you can use std::priority_queue in C++:

// Include the necessary header:

// cpp
// Copy code
// #include <queue>
// Declare a priority queue:
// You need to specify the type of elements stored in the priority queue and the comparator function to determine the order of elements in the heap (by default, it's a max-heap). For example, to create a min-heap of integers:

// cpp
// Copy code
// std::priority_queue<int, std::vector<int>, std::greater<int>> minHeap;
// Here, std::greater<int> is used as the comparator to ensure a min-heap. If you want a max-heap, you can simply use std::less<int> (or omit the third argument since it's the default behavior).

// Operations on the heap:

// Insertion: To insert an element into the heap, you can use the push() method:
// cpp
// Copy code
// minHeap.push(5);
// Removal of the top element: To remove the top element (the root of the heap), you can use the pop() method:
// cpp
// Copy code
// minHeap.pop();
// Accessing the top element: To access the top element of the heap (without removing it), you can use the top() method:
// cpp
// Copy code
// int topElement = minHeap.top();
// By using std::priority_queue, you get a convenient way to implement heaps in C++, with the underlying data structure being a binary heap. The priority queue handles the details of maintaining the heap property during insertion and removal of elements.
